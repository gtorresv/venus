# My Portfolio

## Description

The reason for this website was to have a portfolio webpage that includes the work that I have been doing throughout the bootcamp. Hence, whenever any recruiter wants to know more information about myself and the work I have done, it will be detailed here. 

## Usage

You can access the portfolio website at https://gtorresv.github.io/venus/. When you get to the page you will notice the about me, work, and contact me tabs on the top right side of the webpage. Whenever you click on any of the tabs it will scroll down to its corresponding section.
